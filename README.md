# **What is this?**

This is a fork of Abraham's project, Houdini, but this has a completely dark UI, which I prefer over the transparent one.

I hope you enjoy this!

IPA can be found here *soon*

# Houdini (iOS 11-11.1.2)

# Direct Project Download

this'll soon be replaced with an IPA link, but for now it's the project.

# Is this a full jailbreak?
Nope. Once you run it, Cydia will NOT be installed.

# How can I help?
If you're interested in taking Houdini to the next level and add more features, go for it.
